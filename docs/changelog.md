# Changelog

## 1.7.3 — 2026-10-20

- Changed settings to flow with the main scroll document: they sit at the visible bottom for short content and follow overflowing content below the viewport.
- Removed the separate settings scroller and retained safe, expansion-driven popover sizing.
- Updated macOS layout checks to verify that settings scroll into view with long content, stay low with short content and share one scrollbar when expanded.

## 1.7.2 — 2026-10-20

- Added hover, click and drag inspection to daily usage charts, with persistent day selection and exact token readouts.
- Replaced scientific axis labels with millions (兆 in Chinese) and four complete month/day labels, preserving missing days and explicit zero usage.
- Made account usage history collapsible and hid the redundant period-picker label.
- Pinned settings outside the history scroll area, bounded expanded settings to their own scroll region and compacted the popover when all sections are collapsed.
- Added chart-formatting/date-selection checks and macOS tests for pinned settings and expansion-driven popover resizing.

## 1.7.1 — 2026-10-20

- Fixed popovers showing only the header by removing content-height feedback and setting an explicit, screen-bounded viewport before presentation.
- Kept daily details and settings scrollable without resizing the viewport; clock updates now refresh state without a TimelineView inside the scroll document.
- Added macOS layout checks for first opening, reopening, empty/populated data, smaller screens and scrolling to the end of expanded content.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-10-20

- Automatically publish verified main-branch builds to GitHub Releases, including manual main builds, with permanent ZIP/checksum downloads, exact source tags and a latest-release link.
- Limit release write permission to the main-only publish job, retain temporary artifacts for other builds, and publish only after both assets are uploaded successfully.

- Merged daily analytics into the existing account history section, with one default chart and a collapsed disclosure for daily details, period summaries, lifetime totals and recent quota changes; removed the separate Analytics tab and quota chart.
- Bounded expanded popover content to the screen height, refreshed displayed countdowns/pace on the clock and aligned the menu-bar history with account daily token usage.
- Decoupled quota and daily-history polling, refreshed both concurrently after wake/manual refresh and marked stale history visibly.
- Stopped showing expired-cycle percentages or weekly pace as current, suppressed expired-cycle low-quota alerts and hardened numeric parsing/countdown arithmetic.
- Stopped pending profile logins before deletion, ignored stale completion callbacks, restored a valid active profile after failed sign-in and fixed notification-delivery and banner-dismissal bookkeeping.

- Added account-wide daily token analytics from `account/usage/read`, with 7-day/30-day views, daily details, date lookup, usage sorting and an active-days filter.
- Kept missing days distinct from zero use, separated lifetime statistics from period totals, and isolated analytics errors and pending results during account switches.

- Replaced the app’s local-token activity panel with account-wide remaining-quota history, credit balance and available reset counts, polled every two minutes.
- Persisted isolated account snapshots across restarts and recorded net decreases with their original observation intervals.
- Marked gaps, new quota cycles, replenishment and changed allowances without inventing cross-reset usage; kept missing fields unavailable.
- Retained scheduled reset times, displayed new-cycle used percentages, and paused interval calculations while expired quota windows await a backend update.
- Updated the menu-bar chart to server-provided daily account token usage and kept optional CLI local-token history independent.
- Added offline regression checks for persistence, downtime, reset boundaries, account isolation and storage failures.

## 1.6.2 — 2026-10-11

- Fixed the false “Codex is not installed” error for desktop builds that moved their bundled service into `Contents/Resources/codex-cli/`; support the packaged launcher, nested native executable and legacy layout without a separate CLI installation.
- Added a “Select Codex App…” recovery action for installations outside standard locations, persisted the selected app and refreshed desktop discovery when retrying a missing service.
- Clarified the service-not-found message and included searched paths in sanitized diagnostics.
- Added new-layout fixtures and real process handshake checks through a desktop bundle and its packaged launcher.

## 1.6.1 — 2026-10-11

- Fixed quota bucket selection when modern servers return multiple limit IDs without a `codex` key; use the server’s canonical quota instead of an arbitrary product bucket.
- Find the current or registered desktop application, including renamed apps and user installations; prefer the unified ChatGPT desktop, verify its Codex bundle identity, and support absolute PATH locations.
- Report actual quota window durations, reject failed initialization, and protect replacement clients from callbacks belonging to older processes.
- Keep operation errors separate from quota failures, protect account switches against old refresh results, and prevent notification permission prompts from blocking polling.
- Refresh stale menu-bar state regularly and retry after wake; retain bounded, redacted process diagnostics and empty-response diagnostics for troubleshooting.
- Added official-protocol fixtures, executable discovery checks, initialization/reconnection checks and diagnostic privacy checks.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-10-10

- Added an original macOS application icon, generated as ICNS with native system tools at all standard and Retina sizes; included PNG and ICO source assets.
- Added English and Simplified Chinese interfaces with system language detection, a persistent Settings language selector and immediate UI refresh.
- Localized usage charts, settings, account dialogs, notifications, accessibility labels, dates and common errors; kept CLI output and JSON labels stable in English.
- Added localization regression checks and verified icon and language resources in the final release package.
- Updated installation instructions for current macOS Gatekeeper prompts.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-15

- Added a confirmation choice for Meter-only or Meter plus Codex desktop switching.
- Implemented desktop switching with OpenAI's documented app-server logout, secure browser login, account verification and relaunch flow.
- Fixed Codex opening with the supported settings deep link plus bundle-ID and application-path fallbacks.
- Fixed deletion for stale account records whose local profile directory is already missing.
- Added visible banked-reset counts from OpenAI's authoritative `rateLimitResetCredits.availableCount` field, with an honest unavailable state.
- Added live account-read, reset-history and profile-deletion validation.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-15

- Added confirmed deletion of unused local account profiles and their Codex-owned credentials.
- Clarified the boundary between meter profiles and the separately authenticated Codex desktop app.
- Added an in-app handoff to open Codex for desktop account switching.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-07-15

## 1.3.1 — 2026-07-15

- Added explicit price-source dating, unknown-model handling and custom fallback rates.
- Bumped history JSON to schema version 2 with structured pricing metadata.
- Expanded model-switch, duplicate-log, counter-reset, unknown-model and pricing coverage.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-15
